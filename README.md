# Sorta-Usefull-Shit-I-ve-Made
Description Is In The Name
As the name says this is a repository of stuff that isn't really useful but isn't completely useless.

If you want to copy any code here and claim it as your own I can't stop you, but be cool, don't do that (the C# gods will judge you silently).
